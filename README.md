suppose a client has a problem we call it the actual problem. We now see the problem in a statistical way to know how to form our model to make a solution.This is done by using EDA which is exploratory date analysis. We gather the data from the client and analyse it to form a model. The next step is the statistical solution which is done using performance matrix like MAPE. We take the data that we have and split it in the ratio of 70-30 or 80-20 in such a way that that 70% of the data is put in the model for the computer to analayse the pattern. The remaining 30% is then used to see how accurate the calculated value of the model is to the actual value. Once we have calculated the MAPE we will know if the model is successful or not. Once we come up with the statistical solution we covert the solution into an actual solution which can be understood by the client.
