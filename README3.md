After problem representation we do forecasting specific EDA.
We do a lot of visual representation by plotting varioud graphs to understand our the trends in our dataset.
If there are outliers in our dataser, we do outlier treatment to remove them and then we plot boxplots
we also do kpss and adf tests. Kpss test checks for stationarity and adf test looks for non-stationarity 
by finding the p-value we will know wether to accept or reject the null hypothesis 
we also do Z test and T test on our hypothesis. 
Z-test is the statistical test used to analyze whether two population means are different or not when the variances are known, and the sample size is large.
A T-test is a parametric test applied to identify how the average of two data sets differs when variance is not given.
