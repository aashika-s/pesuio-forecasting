the null hypothesis is a given statement that there is no relationship between two measured cases.
 The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis used in hypothesis testing that is contrary to the null hypothesis.  
Hypothesis testing evaluates two mutually exclusive statements to determine which statement is most supported by sample data
We start our project with representation which is through SGQ
We do gap analysis where we look for problems related to our data and how we can overcome it.
In SGQ we see where our data stands, what are the causes for it and what we can achieve from it. 
Once we have made our SGQ we start with our EDA. We do visual representation to understand the data better and we remove all the faults such as the outliers through treatments.
