We start our project with SGQ where we find the gap between the current state and desired state. 
In gap analysis we come up with questions which we need answers for and which can affect the paramters of our dataset
Once we come up with our SGQ we start with our problem representation.
In problem representation we come up with hypothesis for the questions we formed during gap analysis. Each hypothesis will have futher branches of hypothesis with the highest branch being the most exhaustive. 
Our highest hypothesis will have another layer of hypothesis that will contain questions for which we need to do tests and find answers.
the null hypothesis is a given statement that there is no relationship between two measured cases.
 The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis used in hypothesis testing that is contrary to the null hypothesis.  
Hypothesis testing evaluates two mutually exclusive statements to determine which statement is most support.
